Launch tracking

Edit this issue to keep track of the tasks you're working on towards launch.

We have a rough guide for how to launch a track, which is a good starting point;
please ask if you have any questions or if anything is confusing!
https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/launch/README.md

This you might consider for the exercises (test suites and code examples) in this
track. Open separate issues for the ones you wish to implement.

- Is there a style guide for {{LANGUAGE}}?
- Are these styles encouraged or enforced?
- Are there any conventions that we should adopt on this track for the sake of consistency?
- Can we enforce these?
- Is there a linter? Are there many? Should we use one?
- Is there a common convention for filenames? If not, what should our convention be?

Once you've gotten the track into a state where others can contribute, update the
README to reflect the choices you've made and provide guidelines for contribution.
